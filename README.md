# TMD_Geometries
Calculate geometric parameters for single-pass transmembrane proteins

These codes calculate the following parameters:
- theta: protein helix tilt angle
- kappa: protein helix hingle angle
- sigma: protein TMD residue orientational angle
- membrane width
- residue insertion depths

The included codes are written for specific systems in the MARTINI2.2 coarse grained model. I have many other versions of these codes for different systems and force fields, and would be happy to share those upon request. If I find the time I will publish more versatile versions of these codes for any system and force field, but for now these will have to be modified to suit your needs.
