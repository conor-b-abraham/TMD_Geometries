# TMD_Geometries
Calculate geometric parameters for single-pass transmembrane proteins

If you use these codes, please cite:

Conor B. Abraham, Lin Xu, George A. Pantelopulos, & John E. Straub. Characterizing the transmembrane domains of ADAM10 and BACE1 and the impact of membrane composition. *Biophysical Journal* **2023**, *122*(19), DOI: [10.1016/j.bpj.2023.08.025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.08.025)

These codes calculate the following parameters:
- theta: protein helix tilt angle
- kappa: protein helix hingle angle
- sigma: protein TMD residue orientational angle
- membrane width
- residue insertion depths

The included codes are written for specific systems in the MARTINI2.2 coarse grained model. I have many other versions of these codes for different systems and force fields, and would be happy to share those upon request. If I find the time I will publish more versatile versions of these codes for any system and force field, but for now these will have to be modified to suit your needs.
